## How it works

Below is the basic flow of how our NFT Minting dApp will function:

- Minters will log in on the dApp by connecting their wallet i.e Metamask.

- They will then supply the name, image, and description of the digital asset they want to mint.

- Our NFT minter will turn the digital asset into an NFT when they click the "Mint NFT" button.

- All minted NFTs will be listed on OpenSea Testnet Marketplace where everyone can view them and the owner can also place them for sale üòã.

We'll be making use of the Testnet environments throughout this tutorial, you can apply the same steps when you're ready to deploy to a Mainnet network.

> A Testnet network is merely a functional prototype that works with fake cryptocurrencies for a blockchain project, while the Mainnet network is a fully built blockchain platform that allows users to perform real cryptocurrency transactions on the blockchain.

At the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working dApp that allows anyone to mint their digital assets (images) into an NFT.
